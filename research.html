			<h3 class="norm"> I work with the <b> Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE) </b> to conduct research projects on a topic that matters a lot to me: how we can rethink schools. </h3>

			<h3 class="norm"> Most of the research I conducted was through T600: Thinking and Learning Today and Tomorrow: Project Zero Perspectives. Through this class, I focused my semester-long inquiry on the question <i> How can schools best empower students with learner agency? </i> Starting college, I knew I didn't have the independence or confidence to solve difficult, real-world problems, a reality that none of my K-12 education had forced me to confront. Looking around, I noticed that most of my classmates were in a similar situation: lots of potential frozen by self-erected barriers. But why is that? This became I question I obsessed over for a large portion of my college career. </h3>

			<h2 class="project-title"> <b> Project 1: Investigating Project-Based Learning </b> </h2>

			<h3 class="norm"> I believe that a lot of this issue is rooted in flawed values of what is worth learning in schools. So I began to search for opportunities for change. My first project focused on project-based learning's effect on developing learner agency. I did a comparative study between students at a local private school who have and haven't attended their exchange trimester at Nuvu, a design studio high school in Cambridge, MA. It was surprising to find that on a survey where students were asked to rate their own creativity, confidence, and curiosity, students exposed to project-based learning fared no better, or even ranked themselves worse. However, when it came to actually building their solutions through the design challenge, students with project-based learning backgrounds built to their ideas, while others built to their materials. For example, while students from Nuvu were trying to build wild ideas like food cannons out of play doh and paper plates, BCDS students made only foods that were true to color based on the play doh colors provided. They limited their possibilities by the materials they were given, thus reducing the scope of what they could actually build. Their options were more limited by their mindset than their capabilities. </h3>

			<h2 class="project-title"> <b> Project 2: Becoming Creative, Confident, and Curious</b> </h2>

			<h3 class="norm"> For my second mini project, I interviewed multiple undergraduates to hear what experiences they found most formative in making them entrepreneurs, innovators, and creative thinkers. They each drew a map representing their learner paths, and answered questions on whether they found themselves to be creative, confident, and curious and what helped them become that way. I identified creativity, confidence, and curiosity as capacities that generally connected to learner agency. Many found informal learning experiences to be the most formative, ones where they were able to dictate the goals and processes of their own learning. This often led to a general confidence towards everything they did. One spoke about how anything could be done by just "ignoring that little voice of doubt." Another mentioned that success was internally driven by "the hustle inside of you to learn whatever you want whenever you need it." Others who were less independent as learners would speak about primarily external influences that affected their work, such as only being creative when given permission and only trying when people they respected were evaluating their work. The personal narratives from each of the participants revealed patterns that students typically followed to develop learner agency that I then categorized into five steps. </h3>

			<div class="project-pic hierarchy"> </div>

			<h3 class="norm"> The path starts with some opportunity for independent expression, such as photography or a science fair project. This often led to positive external recognition, which then encouraged students to push the boundaries of their own capabilities. A cyclic process of pushing boundaries and facing failures and successes led to more control over their own learning. This then could spread to confidently approaching any problem they faced in that field. Some students developed a method they could generalize to any problem, such as confidence in their ability to silence the voice of doubt or confidence in their ability to learn any necessary information. At this point, students were able to take control of their learning in multiple contexts. This greatly expanded the scope of what students saw as possible, and thus expanded the scope of what they were capable of. </h3>
