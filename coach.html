		<h2> "I can clearly distinguish my entrepreneurial journey into two periods: Before and After I started working with Connie." </h2>

		<p style="text-align: center"> <i> Before I met Connie, there were instances where the weight of my anxiety, stress, and the pressure I was under felt utterly suffocating. I would get sucked into spirals of panic because I didn’t know how to break the mental cycles I fell into when things at my startup didn’t go as expected. At times, I felt completely isolated in the circumstances I was facing, and would feel mentally stuck and burnt out. Along came my godsend, Connie. Connie has fundamentally changed the way I think for the better. She’s asked deep questions that have expanded my awareness of my own flaws and superpowers, and has helped me set goals for breaking counterproductive mental models that have long been rooted in my brain. This has ultimately led me to become a more productive, confident, and proactive leader. Since becoming her client, every major win I’ve achieved as a founder could not have been possible without the fundamental, inner progress I’ve made through my sessions with Connie.  </i></p>

		<h2> "Connie’s blend of startup experience and emotional intelligence is a powerful pairing." </h2>

		<p style="text-align: center"> <i> From our first call, Connie immediately helped me take steps towards moving through challenges I had been mentally stuck on for years. She helped me uncover why certain challenges were especially draining for me, building my understanding of myself as a leader and creating clarity about how to address problems at the root. Her blend of startup experience and emotional intelligence is a powerful pairing, and I would highly recommend Connie to other executives looking to grow both as leaders and as people. </i></p>

		<p style="text-align: center"> <i> I came to Connie afraid to face what I wanted in my career, and she got me to see the best version of myself and believe I could make that version real. I uncovered dreams I didn't know I had. Connie brought structure to my chaos and confidence to my uncertainties. I'm so grateful.  </i></p>

		<p style="text-align: center"> <i> Connie helped bring much-needed clarity, process, and confidence into my life. She is an incredible listener and made me feel so understood throughout our time working together, which made it easy to be completely honest and vulnerable with my thoughts—a true gift that allowed me to reveal things to myself that I had not previously considered. I can say, without a doubt, that working with Connie was the best investment in myself I could have made as I prepared for a big shift in my professional life. </i></p>

		<h2> "As a woman of color in leadership, I feel seen." </h2>

		<p style="text-align: center"> <i> I originally started working with Connie to launch a social venture. Connie's guidance started by helping me take concrete steps, but soon we were uncovering long-held limiting beliefs that were holding me back. Connie ultimately guided me through an extremely challenging transition from my demanding, full-time role. As a woman of color in leadership, I found Connie's advice and guiding questions deeply resonant. She also reached out to check in with me outside our meeting times and helped me feel less alone during a very difficult time. I am truly grateful for Connie's coaching and look forward to working with her again! </i></p>
