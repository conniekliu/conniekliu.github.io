			<p id = "project_content_text_lovehandles" > Meet Lovehandles. Packed in that small(ish) exterior is 36V of battery, a Turnigy SK3 brushless motor, a full size Kelly controller, and enough power to hit 20 mph with a single rider. </p>

			<p id = "project_content_text_lovehandles"> Lovehandles was the brainchild of Rachel Lathe and I during the special section of MIT's Design and Manufacturing class (2.007), or affectionately called 2.00Go Kart. We were posed with a few design constraints from the start: no more than four 12V batteries, a maximum speed of 20 mph (for safety reasons), the ability to carry a single rider, and a cost of under $500. With these parameters in mind, we set out to conceptualize, design, and finally build what is now Lovehandles. </p>

			<p id = "project_content_text_lovehandles"> Our go kart started as a few early stage, somewhat unrealistic ideas on paper. After completing design critiques with the class instructors, we redrafted our plans. Lovehandles began to take shape. </p>

			<p> Our initial prototypes began with MDF brackets and lots of masking tape. To test sizing and avoid wasting expensive parts, we laser cut MDF to test our parts before sending them over to the water jet to be cut out of aluminum. This small act of precaution made a huge difference as we discovered that our original design was very susceptible to high bending stresses. We added additional 80/20 for support and for the structure to more easily carry heavier weights. We also re-designed the electronics deck to make the parts more serviceable if a fuse blew or the controller broke in the middle of the race (both of which happened). </p>

			<p> This progressed to much larger challenges. Our steering design went through many phases of development as we tuned it to a prefect balance of minimizing turning radius and maximizing safety at high speeds. In addition, our efforts to keep the vehicle small led to some fancy maneuvering to fit all of our parts in for the back wheel assembly, which ended up in a highly efficient design maximizing the power translated from motor torque to rear wheel drive. And for your enjoyment, here is a picture of me having loads of fun on our nearly completed go kart! </p>

			<h2 class = "purple"> <b>Lessons Learned </b> </h2>
			<p> Designing and building Lovehandles was not only a lot of fun and excitement, but also a huge learning experience. To submit to my love of lists, here are a few skills I picked up along the way: </p>

			<p> <b> Budgeting: </b> One huge component of the class were our weekly purchase orders. Material purchases could only be made on Tuesdays, and that meant lots of foresight and planning purchases way ahead of time. With this and the $500 budget constraint, obtaining supplies became somewhat of a struggle, especially during the later weeks. </p>

			<p> <b> Shop Smarts: </b> There were multiple times in the course of this class that my life was in danger. However, under the watchful eyes of the shop instructors, I was able to escape many a near death experience with consistent hair tying, goggle wearing, and general self-awaredness. This was my introduction to using many of the tools that I now know and love, including dremels, the cold saw, the in-shop mini lathe, water jet, and many more. </p>

			<p> <b> Designing for Assembly: </b> This was not only a lesson in designing realistically in Solidworks with assembly in mind, but also in not ordering the cheapest materials from Mcmaster-Carr with the expectation that it would also be of the highest quality. "You get what you pay for" definitely applies in the go kart world as we spent many an hour sanding down shafts and scrambling for replacement sprockets to compensate for our mispurchases. </p>

			<p> <b> Time Management: </b> Despite our many fortuitous successes, there were things we could have improved had there been more time. For example, I would love to have taken the time to enable a reverse driving mode. With the powerhouse of a controller we bought, we had a lot of cool features that we could have enabled, but were unable to explore many of them. </p>
